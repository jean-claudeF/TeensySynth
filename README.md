# Teensy Synthesizer experiments
Around 1977 I built my first analogue synthesizer. It was the time when a Moog synth was so expensive that DIY was really interesting. Some time after this, keyboards with many possibilities got so cheap that building them seemed no more interesting. Nowadays the microcontrollers and SoCs are so evolved and so cheap that I became interested in renewing with an old passion.

My first goal was to build a MCO (MIDI controlled oscillator) as compared to the VCO (voltage controlled oscillator of the MOOG synthesizer). Maybe I could reuse some of the other componentss of my analogue synthesizer, like filters etc. ?

This is a blog about my experiments:

It was important for me to go the slow path, trying to understand everything I do, and going on with small steps.

Thanks a lot to Paul Stoffregen for his wonderful Teensy audio library, and to Notes and Volts from whom I borrowed some ideas, especially the key buffer.

Thanks also a lot to manicksan for his wonderful tool:

I have begun writing a documentation on it:

One of Mannicken's examples is a rather complex polysynth. To better understand how it works, I tried to grasp its basic structure:
